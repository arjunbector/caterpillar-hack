        The provided box plot visualizes the distribution of air filter pressure
        values across three different risk statuses: High Risk, Medium Risk, and
        Low Risk. The plot is used to identify how air filter pressure varies
        with different levels of risk.

            <strong>High Risk:</strong> Median Value: Approximately 34.
            Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is relatively narrow, indicating
            that the values are closely packed around the median. Range: The
            overall range (from minimum to maximum) is between approximately 33
            to 36, showing low variability within this category.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Medium Risk:</strong> Median Value: Approximately 30.
            Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is wider compared to the High
            Risk category, indicating more variability in the air filter
            pressure values. Range: The values range between 26 and 32. This
            category shows more spread in values than High Risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Low Risk:</strong> Median Value: Approximately 28.
            Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is the widest among the three
            categories, indicating the highest variability in the values.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Range:</strong> The values range between 22 and 30. The
            broader range suggests that in the Low Risk category, air filter
            pressure values can vary significantly.

        <strong>Conclusion:</strong>The box plot effectively illustrates how air
        filter pressure values vary by risk status. The data suggests a clear
        correlation between higher air filter pressure and increased risk. The
        low variability in the High Risk category implies a strong and
        consistent relationship, whereas the Low Risk category shows greater
        variability, indicating that other factors might be influencing the air
        filter pressure in theseÂ conditions.
